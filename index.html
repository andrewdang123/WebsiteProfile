    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        My first position was as a Crew Member at McDonald's. Within a few months, I was promoted to <br>
        the position of Crew Trainer, where I trained new employees into their own position as a Crew Member.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my second year at Carleton, I was able to secure a Teaching Assistant position for COMP1405/1406Z. <br>
        This was an accelerated version of COMP 1405 and COMP 1406 for exceptional students, <br>
        open to those with a Shopify Dev Degree, or have an admission average of 90%. It was my role to ensure <br>
        these students quickly grasp and master the complex concepts and enhance their programming skills.
